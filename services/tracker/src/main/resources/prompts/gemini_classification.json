			"text": "Definitions:"
		  },
		  {
			"text": "*   **organic:** Items derived from living things, such as food scraps, yard waste, and untreated wood."
		  },
		  {
			"text": "*   **recyclable:** Items that can be processed and reused as new materials. This includes common materials like paper, cardboard, plastic bottles (depending on local recycling programs), aluminum cans, and glass."
		  },
		  {
			"text": "*   **non_recyclable:** Items that cannot be recycled, typically due to their material composition or contamination. This includes things like certain types of plastic, styrofoam, and multi-layered materials."
		  },
		  {
			"text": "*   **trash:** Items that are generally considered unusable due to contamination, damage, or other factors, and should go to a landfill. This includes items that might be made of recyclable materials but are no longer suitable for recycling (e.g., a heavily soiled pizza box, broken glass)."
		  },
		  {
			"text": "*   **eletronic:** Items containing eletronic components, including circuit boards, batteries, and wires. This category includes devices like smartphones, computers, appliances, and batteries themselves."
		  },

			"text": "The item to be classified will be provided in the format: 'Classify: [item description]'"
		  },
		  {
			"text": "Your response MUST be ONLY ONE of these words (organic, recyclable, non_recyclable, trash, eletronic), with no extra text, punctuation, explanation, or formatting. Returning anything else will be considered an error."
		  },
		  {
			"text": "If an item could fall into multiple categories (e.g., a broken eletronic device), prioritize the following order: eletronic > trash > non_recyclable > recyclable > organic. This means if an item is both eletronic and trash, your response should be 'eletronic'."
		  },
		  {
			"text": "If the item does not fit into any of the above categories, classify it as 'non_recyclable'."
